Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible.

      "CFO": "As the CFO, I have some significant concerns about hiring Ashley Thomas for the Head of Technology role in our recycling plant scale-up. Let me break down my reasoning based on the specific evaluation criteria relevant to my role:\n\n1. **Financial Acumen:** While Ashley has some technical experience, her resume does not indicate any substantial experience in budgeting or cost control for technology investments. This role requires a robust understanding of financial strategy to make intelligent tech investments without overspending. We need someone who has demonstrated the ability to manage large-scale budgets and make fiscally responsible decisions, which Ashley\u2019s experience does not sufficiently cover.\n\n2. **ROI Mindset:** The job demands someone who has a track record of implementing technology to yield efficiency improvements and, consequently, financial returns. Ashley\u2019s experience primarily revolves around web development, managing websites, and frontend tasks. While these skills are valuable, there's no indication she has experience optimizing operations or driving ROI through technological innovations on a massive scale, which is essential for us.\n\n3. **Risk Management:** We need a leader who has established mitigation strategies for technology-related financial risks. Ashley\u2019s resume does not provide any evidence of her handling large-scale risk management, especially in financially sensitive environments. Her background does not align with the need for stringent risk mitigation in a complex and growing supply chain.\n\n4. **Data Analytics:** Leveraging technology for financial forecasting and reporting is critical. While Ashley has dipped into data handling like using APIs and AJAX calls, there's no indication that she has worked extensively with predictive analytics or used data engineering to inform financial decisions at an executive level.\n\n5. **Vendor Negotiation:** Lastly, the ability to negotiate and manage cost-effective tech partnerships is crucial. Ashley\u2019s resume does not highlight any experience in selecting or negotiating with vendors and suppliers. We need someone with a demonstrated ability to manage external partnerships while controlling costs effectively.\n\nIn summary, Ashley Thomas, while clearly skilled in her current domain, does not meet the demanding requirements of this senior, multifaceted role from a financial perspective. Her skills and experience do not align well with our needs for robust budgeting, risk management, and driving a strong ROI. I strongly believe we should look for a candidate with deeper experience in tech leadership and proven financial acumen to maximize profitability and ensure financial stability for our ambitious project.",
      "VP of Engineering": "Alright team, let me dive straight into this evaluation of Ashley Thomas for the Head of Technology role. I am quite adamant about getting the right leadership in place because this is crucial for our ambitious scaling plans and optimizing the technological framework we have in place. Here's my take:\n\n**Proven Expertise in Industrial Process Automation and Optimization:**\nI'll be frank, Ashley's resume doesn't instill confidence in this aspect. Her experience primarily revolves around web development and front-end technologies, which is miles away from the intricacies of industrial process automation. We are talking about ensuring efficiency in the entire recycling process chain\u2014from collection to sorting to processing. This requires specialized knowledge in industrial machinery, IoT sensors, and automation technologies, and Ashley simply doesn\u2019t have it. This gap is too significant to overlook.\n\n**Strong Track Record in Scaling Engineering Teams:**\nAshley has held titles like Web Developer Intern, Front End Developer, and Web Manager. These roles are fundamentally different from what's required to build and scale a robust engineering team in a supply chain context. There's no evidence in her resume that she's successfully led large teams, especially in a high-stakes, fast-scaling environment. For this role, we need someone who has proven experience in rallying and growing engineering teams under pressure\u2014an absolute non-negotiable in our line of work.\n\n**Experience with Recycling-Specific Technology and Machinery:**\nNot a single mention of recycling technology or machinery experience in her background. Transitioning into this sector isn't just about learning new tools; it's about understanding the entire ecosystem\u2014from the science behind the waste materials to the technological requirements of processing them efficiently. Our goals are too complex to be a training ground for someone new to the field.\n\n**Proven Ability to Innovate Under Resource Constraints:**\nWhile Ashley does show some initiative in terms of creating wireframes and coding, this is mainly in a resource-rich environment with established tools. There's no demonstration of delivering substantial innovation under constrained resources, which is the daily reality of our operations in Kenya. We need someone who has a knack for creating impactful solutions even when resources are limited, and Ashley doesn\u2019t bring that verified capacity to the table.\n\n**Familiar with Local Regulatory and Environmental Standards:**\nGiven her work history in the US, Ashley also doesn't appear familiar with the regulatory and environmental standards we need to adhere to locally in Kenya. This is another critical area where on-the-ground experience and local knowledge are invaluable, and she falls short.\n\nIn conclusion, while Ashley might be a strong web developer, she is not the right fit for a critical leadership role in our organization. We need someone with a different skill set and experience tailored much more closely to our immediate and strategic needs.\n\nThank you for considering my perspective on this. Let's continue to seek out candidates who meet our stringent criteria and can drive us forward without such fundamental gaps in experience and expertise.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "Alright, let's talk about the candidate, Ashley Thomas, for the position of Head of Technology in our recycling plant scale-up in Kenya. Here are my thoughts, based on our evaluation criteria:\n\n### Evaluation Criteria and Analysis\n\n#### Proven Scaling Experience in Recycling Technology\nI must be upfront here\u2014I don't see any direct experience in Ashley's resume that demonstrates significant scaling in recycling technology. Her experience as a Web Developer Intern at Pinger Inc and as a Front End Developer for Pink Blush doesn\u2019t directly translate to experience in scaling recycling technologies or dealing with complex supply chains unique to our industry.\n\n#### Deep Understanding of Kenyan Regulatory Landscape\nThere's no indication in Ashley's resume that she possesses a deep understanding of the Kenyan regulatory landscape. This is critical given the numerous local regulations and compliance requirements we need to navigate. A candidate who has worked within Kenya or similar African markets could provide invaluable insights specific to our operational needs.\n\n#### Strong Track Record in Waste Stream Optimization\nAshley's background is primarily in web development and managing web content, such as her role at Lush Clothing and Pink Blush. There is little to no information suggesting she has experience with waste stream optimization\u2014an essential component for maximizing efficiency in our recycling process.\n\n#### Expertise in Cost-Efficient Tech Solutions Implementation\nWhile Ashley has experience creating marketing emails and managing web pages, the scope of cost-efficient tech solutions for a digital product environment is vastly different from what we need. Implementing cost-efficient technology solutions in a resource-limited setting like ours requires experience in finding high-ROI processes, particularly in hardware and software innovations related to manufacturing and environmental technologies.\n\n#### Leadership in Multicultural and Resource-Limited Settings\nAshley\u2019s resume does not provide much evidence of leadership experience in multicultural and resource-limited settings, let alone in the developing world context like Kenya. While she has held a managerial position as a Web Manager, the scope and scale appear limited compared to what we demand from a Head of Technology.\n\n### Conclusion\nI honestly feel that Ashley Thomas, despite her technical skills, would not be the best fit for our role of Head of Technology. Her experience is specialized in web development and digital content, with no clear indicators of experience relevant to our recycling plant\u2019s technology and scaling requirements. What we need is someone with proven expertise in these specific areas to help us grow and optimize our scale-up operations efficiently.\n\nWe should look for a candidate who has more direct experience in the fields of recycling technology, regulatory compliance in Kenya, and cost-efficient tech innovations in resource-limited settings. This kind of specialization will be crucial for us to meet our objectives of improving efficiency, reducing waste, and ensuring safety and profitability.\n\nI urge my partners to consider these points strongly and to rethink if Ashley Thomas is the right choice for the role."

    "job_title": "# Head of Technology in a Recycling plant scale-up in Kenya",
    "job_description": "\ufeffAbout Our Client \nThis is a recycling company on a mission to change people\u2019s lives. Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage.",
