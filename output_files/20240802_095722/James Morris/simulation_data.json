Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible.

      "CFO": "Alright, let me be blatantly honest here. This resume from James Morris leaves me with deep concern about his suitability for the Head of Technology role in our scaling recycling plant in Kenya. Let\u2019s break it down using my criteria:\n\n**1. Proven financial acumen in tech investments:** James' resume lacks any explicit mention of handling significant tech investments, especially not on a scale that aligns with our financial ambitions. We need someone who can judiciously manage and allocate resources across intricate tech deployments. I genuinely do not see any evidence of him having the financial acumen required to strategize and execute multi-million dollar tech investments. \n\n**2. Cost-effective innovation in recycling technology:** James does have some technical agility and project management experience, but he doesn\u2019t showcase familiarity with recycling technologies or cost-saving innovations specific to our industry. It\u2019s not enough to be just tech-savvy; we need someone who understands the intersection of technology and recycling, and can pinpoint where tech can reduce costs effectively within this specific context.\n\n**3. Risk management in tech deployment:** Again, James doesn\u2019t provide solid proof that he has competently managed high-stakes risks in tech deployment. His experience seems largely relegated to maintenance and upgrading tasks within a single company context, which can\u2019t compare to the multifaceted risk environment we operate in. We need someone with a strong and proven track record in risk assessment and mitigation during large-scale tech rollouts. \n\n**4. ROI-focused project management experience:** We've seen James handle entry-level IT responsibilities and advance to a Project Manager, but his achievements don't scream ROI-focused project management. Cost-saving innovations like preventing email crashes and upgrading computers, while commendable, do not equate to the complex ROI calculations we'll need from our Head of Technology when deploying innovative solutions across supply chains or new countries. \n\n**5. Financial literacy in tech-related fiscal policies:** This might be the most glaring gap. There is absolutely no mention of experience with tech-related fiscal policies, budget management, or financial planning. Given my position and priorities, I find this unacceptable. Whoever takes this role must be financially literate and adept at marrying technical know-how with financial strategy\u2014someone who can prepare robust financial justifications for tech expenditures and monitor their impact meticulously.\n\nTo sum up, we need a strategic leader who isn\u2019t just technically sound but is financially astute, experienced in large-scale investments, and proficient in risk management and budget forecasting. James Morris does not meet these criteria, and therefore, in my opinion, he\u2019s not the right fit for this pivotal role. This is about steering the technological ship of a growing enterprise, not just managing the existing simple tech environment. We can\u2019t afford to compromise here.\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts, but I stand firm on this assessment.",
      "VP of Engineering": "Alright, let's get down to brass tacks regarding James Morris for the Head of Technology role in our Kenyan recycling plant scale-up.\n\nMy **evaluation criteria** are:\n\n1. **Technical leadership in zero-waste processes and recycling technology.**\n2. **Proven experience scaling industrial operations in emerging markets.**\n3. **Strong grasp of automation and IoT for industrial efficiency.**\n4. **Demonstrated ability to mentor and develop engineering teams.**\n5. **Track record of integrating sustainable practices within engineering projects.**\n\nStarting with the **pros**:\n\n1. **Technical Skills**: James has a solid foundation in various technical skills pertinent to our requirements. His experience with IT system upgrades, email recovery, and installing and managing a NAS system indicates a good understanding of fundamental IT infrastructure.\n  \n2. **Project Management**: James has held a project management role where he demonstrated organizational skills, such as improving processing times and handling multiple tasks efficiently.\n  \n3. **Problem-Solving**: His ability to recover large Outlook PST files and upgrade outdated operating systems shows resourcefulness and a hands-on approach to problem-solving.\n\nHowever, here are the **cons**, and frankly, they outweigh the pros for this specific role:\n\n1. **Lack of Relevant Industry Experience**: James does not have experience in the recycling industry or with zero-waste processes, which are crucial for this role. Our company is deeply rooted in these principles, and we need someone who can seamlessly integrate and advance our sustainability initiatives.\n\n2. **Scaling Industrial Operations**: There is no evidence in his resume to demonstrate he has scaled industrial operations, let alone in an emerging market like Kenya. Managing industrial-scale technology operations in such a context requires a unique set of skills and understanding, which James appears to lack.\n\n3. **Automation and IoT**: While he has some technical know-how, there is no mention of experience with automation and IoT for industrial efficiency. Our business relies heavily on these technologies to optimize processes across the supply chain, and not having this expertise is a significant gap.\n\n4. **Mentorship and Team Development**: The resume does not showcase any experience in mentoring or developing engineering teams. For a leadership role, especially one that oversees such a technical and geographically dispersed team, this is non-negotiable.\n\n5. **Sustainability Integration**: Lastly, there's no demonstrated track record of integrating sustainable practices within engineering projects. This role is about driving eco-innovation at scale, and it\u2019s critical that our Head of Technology has proven experience here.\n\nIn conclusion, while James has commendable project management skills and basic technical expertise, he falls short in critical areas that are non-negotiable for this role. We need someone with a robust background in recycling technology, industrial scaling, automation, team development, and sustainable practices. I strongly believe we should consider other candidates who better match our criteria and bring the depth of expertise this role demands. \n\nThank you for your attention.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "### Evaluation Criteria:\n1. Proven recycling tech optimization experience (e.g., waste separation, sorting).\n2. Regional waste management regulatory knowledge (Kenyan context preferred).\n3. Scalable technology implementation in resource-limited settings.\n4. Strong data-driven decision-making abilities (efficiency metrics).\n5. Successful collaboration fostering between tech, operations, and supply chain teams.\n\n---\n\nFirstly, I want to be upfront: I am not completely sold on hiring James Morris for the Head of Technology position, and I have strong reservations. Let me break down why I feel this way, based on our evaluation criteria relevant to the recycling plant and its operations:\n\n1. **Proven Recycling Tech Optimization Experience**: \n   James Morris brings a solid technical foundation, but his experience is largely confined to IT support, document control, and desktop/server management. While he managed an IT setup successfully at A.D.S. Engineering, there\u2019s no direct indication that he has worked with recycling technologies such as waste separation or sorting systems. The technology in our recycling plant is very specific and requires someone with hands-on experience in optimizing these processes. **This can't be overlooked\u2014** we can't afford to have someone learning on the job when we\u2019re scaling up.\n\n2. **Regional Waste Management Regulatory Knowledge (Kenyan Context Preferred)**: \n   He has no experience or indication of knowledge about Kenyan waste management regulations. This is critical for compliance and efficient operations. Implementing tech solutions without understanding local regulations could lead to costly legal repercussions and inefficiencies. **Kenya\u2019s waste management landscape is unique, and a lack of familiarity here is a major red flag.**\n\n3. **Scalable Technology Implementation in Resource-Limited Settings**:\n   James has shown some ability to scale IT infrastructure in a previous role, such as installing NAS for data storage. However, the context was within a U.S. engineering firm, not a resource-limited setting like ours in Kenya. There is a massive difference between upgrading office computers and implementing scalable tech in a growing recycling plant in Africa. **We need someone who has not only done this before but thrived in similar environments.**\n\n4. **Strong Data-Driven Decision-Making Abilities (Efficiency Metrics)**:\n    While he did achieve some impressive tasks such as reducing processing time and email recovery, these don\u2019t necessarily translate to our needs. We require someone deeply skilled in using data to drive large-scale operational efficiencies. Things like sensor data and predictive analytics aren't visibly a part of his experience. **A recycling operation requires robust, data-driven decision-making to optimize the supply chain, and this simply doesn\u2019t show in his resume.**\n\n5. **Successful Collaboration Fostering Between Tech, Operations, Supply Chain Teams**:\n    I do see potential here given his experience with email management and teaching colleagues, but these are limited examples. Leading cross-functional teams in a high-stakes, innovative, and operational capacity is fundamentally different. To deliver on our goals, we need someone with a proven track record in fostering and managing complex collaborations. **Building a cohesive team that spans technology and operational aspects of our supply chain is non-negotiable.**\n\nIn summary, while James Morris has some commendable technical skills and achievements, **I strongly believe he's not the right fit for our strategic needs at this critical juncture.** We need an individual with directly relevant experience in recycling tech optimization, regulatory knowledge, scaling technology in resource-limited settings, strong data-driven decision-making, and proven success in collaborative roles.\n\nWe should prioritize candidates who tick these boxes to ensure we meet our ambition to revolutionize waste management efficiently and compliantly in Kenya and beyond. **Selecting the right Head of Technology is not just about what technical skills they bring, but how directly those skills apply to our unique challenges and goals.**\n\nLet's find someone more aligned with our specific needs and vision."
