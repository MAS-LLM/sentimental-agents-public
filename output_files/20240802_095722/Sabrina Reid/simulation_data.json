After setting up a Twitter application and obtaining the appropriate API Keys, I cloned the twitter- bot-bootstrap repository by spences10 in a new directory and installed the necessary dependencies via Node Package Manager. Using twitter bot bootstrap, not only was I able to code the hashtags for retweets and response messages, I was also able to filter out tweets that contained certain \"offensive\" words and phrases.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Built a website for a client to help them grow their youtube following. The client wanted viewers to be able to subscribe to his channel and view his videos on his site. He also wanted to be able to view his channels analytics from the site including a live subscriber counter. This was achieved with HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Wordpress, and the Youtube API. I created a custom Wordpress theme to the client's exact\u00a0 specifications and used the Youtube API to pull information from the client's Youtube page. The site helped his channel gain about 13,000 new subscribers in 4 months. WordPress Developer AppsByMax Inc February 2018 to June 2018 \u2022 Built a new custom WordPress Theme to serve as the AppsByMax company homepage.

CEO then requested a Redesign of the site, which was completed in 2 days.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Created a brand new WordPress post type, \u201cProducts\u201d, to showcase all of the apps created by AppsByMax. The Products archive page was modified to display the Products in a style similar to Pinterest using Masonry.js\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Hardcoded a slideshow into the Products post type separate from the content to cycle through all of the post\u2019s image attachments. It\u2019s meant to be used as a way to display screenshots and photos without inserting them into the content.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 The Products post type can dynamically add app store badges when provided with URL metadata through custom fields. Using the provided metadata, the Products post adds an appropriate app store badge that links to the URL at the bottom of the post.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Added a new menu to the WordPress dashboard, \u201cSocial Media Links\u201d that allow\u2019s AppsByMax to input the URLs to their various social media accounts. When a URL is entered, the corresponding icon of the site appears in the footer and, when clicked, will bring the user to the linked URL. Volunteer Senior Front- End Developer Code for Social Good January 2017 to February 2018 \u2022 Organized and directed Front- End development of a recently released monumental web app that connects non-profit organizations with technical volunteers around the world. The app is built using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Angular 2, Typescript, and Materialize CSS. Visit us at app.code4socialgood.org\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Built original SignUp, Login, and Forgot Password pages from scratch using the Reactive Forms Module and Validators imported from Angular 2's form library. Reactive Forms would allow for more straightforward communication of data between our server and project components.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Constructed the original User Dashboard, along with the Non-Profit Dashboard by importing the Reactive Forms Module and Validators from the form library. By taking advantage of the Angular library's built-in Validator functions such as .required and .minlength, I was able to prevent users from moving forward with account and project creation without providing the server with certain bits of data.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 Created About page featuring Google Map of all volunteers on site. Because Angular isn't optimized to support the Google Maps API, I imported the AGM framework from SebastianM into the project. This allowed me to be able to display data for every registered volunteer on the map with a marker using Angular's *for directive. With volunteer data available on the map, nonprofit organizations can see if any volunteers registered to our app are in their area very quickly without even creating an account.

Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans.

This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap.

      "CFO": "Alright, let's get into this. My role as CFO is to scrutinize any candidate's potential impact on our financial health and strategic growth. Here\u2019s my assessment based on Sabrina Reid's resume and the requirements for the Head of Technology in our scale-up.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n\n1. **Financial Acumen:** The role of Head of Technology involves significant CapEx and OpEx considerations. We need someone who can make smart financial decisions in tech investments, and it doesn't seem like Sabrina has direct experience managing large-scale budgets or making high-stakes financial decisions. She\u2019s been a freelance web developer and has some experience at a mid-level company but being head of technology for a company that\u2019s scaling rapidly in Kenya requires a different level of financial insight and rigor.\n\n2. **Cost-Effectiveness:** While Sabrina has completed projects under tight deadlines, cost-control in a leadership role requires a deep understanding of budget management. There\u2019s no direct evidence from her bio that she\u2019s had to work within strict budget constraints or optimize for cost-effectiveness at scale.\n\n3. **Risk Management:** This role needs someone capable of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with tech investments. Building a few web applications and managing smaller scope projects doesn't give me confidence that Sabrina has the depth of experience needed to handle tech risks in a fast-growing, complex environment like ours.\n\n4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Compliance is another grey area for Sabrina. There\u2019s no mention of experience with regulatory frameworks, which is vital given the sensitivity of data and the complexity of our operations.\n\n5. **Vendor Negotiation:** We need to negotiate favorable terms with tech vendors to keep costs down and value high. Sabrina\u2019s portfolio indicates limited interaction with such large-scale vendors or strategic partnerships. This is a critical gap given our own needs and the complexity of managing numerous technical domains and vendors.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nI honestly don't believe Sabrina Reid is the right fit for the Head of Technology role at our recycling plant scale-up. While she has commendable experience as a web developer and her projects are innovative, the leap to a strategic leadership role overseeing a broad tech landscape with significant financial implications is too vast. She doesn't have the demonstrated experience in budget control, risk management, regulatory compliance, or vendor negotiation that I deem essential for this role. \n\nHer background is rich in technical creativity but lacking in the financial and management acumen needed for us to achieve our lofty ambitions while maintaining robust fiscal health.\n\nI urge you all to consider the substantial financial and strategic risks of moving forward with a candidate who doesn\u2019t tick these crucial boxes. We need someone who fits our comprehensive criteria right from the start to ensure sustainable growth and operational excellence. \n\n*[CFO stops speaking]*",
      "VP of Engineering": "Alright, let's dive into this. Evaluating Sabrina Reid based on our criteria:\n\n1. **Proven Technical Innovation in Recycling Plant Technologies:** Sabrina has significant experience in web development, including building custom applications and optimizing user experience. However, I am not seeing any specific experience related to recycling plant technologies. This raises a red flag for me. The unique demands of a recycling plant require someone with proven experience in innovative recycling technologies or, at the very least, industrial automation. Her freelance web development experience, while impressive, does not directly translate to the highly specific needs of our complex technological environment in a recycling facility.\n\n2. **Experience Scaling Engineering Teams in Emerging Markets:** There\u2019s no mention of her experience in scaling engineering teams, especially in emerging markets. The crux of our job is to expand operations seamlessly across Kenya and potentially other African countries. Leaders in this role need to have hands-on experience managing and scaling tech teams in similar environments. Her background primarily consists of freelance and contract work with limited evidence of managing large teams, which is crucial for the effective leadership we need.\n\n3. **Strong Change Management for Tech-Driven Process Improvement:** Sabrina has shown she can handle high-pressure situations and quick redesigns, evidenced by her swift turnarounds on projects like those at AppsByMax. However, change management at the scale we're considering involves aligning cross-functional teams and stakeholders, and managing substantial organizational changes beyond coding sprints. There\u2019s no substantial evidence in her resume that she has experience managing tech-driven transformations in complex operational settings like ours.\n\n4. **Track Record in Sustainable Engineering Practices:** There is no indication that Sabrina has been involved in sustainable engineering practices. Our mission is deeply rooted in sustainability, and it\u2019s imperative our Head of Technology has a solid track record in this area. We need someone who understands the specific challenges and innovations related to sustainable waste management and recycling.\n\n5. **Financial Acumen for Tech Investment and Budgeting:** While her work kind of demonstrates technical competence, Sabrina's resume lacks evidence of financial acumen in managing substantial tech investments or budgeting for large-scale technological deployments. We\u2019re looking for a strategic leader who can make sound financial decisions to drive our tech roadmap. Her resume does not provide concrete evidence of these capabilities.\n\n**In summary**: Sabrina has a solid technical background with evident skills in web development, UX/UI design, and front-end technologies. However, she lacks concrete experience in the critical areas of recycling technologies, team scaling in emerging markets, large-scale change management, sustainable engineering practices, and financial tech management. Hence, I cannot recommend her for the Head of Technology role in our scaling recycling plant operations. We need a leader with directly relevant experience to drive our mission forward successfully.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "As the Recycling Plant Manager, I strongly believe that Sabrina Reid is not the right fit for the Head of Technology role in our ambitious recycling plant scale-up in Kenya. Let me break down why, based on my specific evaluation criteria:\n\n1. **Proven process optimization in recycling stream**: While Sabrina has showcased her technical expertise across various web development projects, there is a notable lack of experience in optimizing processes within the recycling or waste management industry. She has proficiently built websites and applications, but these achievements don't translate directly to the hands-on process improvement needed in our recycling stream.\n\n2. **Expertise in sustainable waste management tech**: Sabrina's resume does not demonstrate any direct involvement with sustainable waste management technologies. This role requires an intimate understanding of how to leverage technology to enhance recycling processes, reduce waste, and implement sustainable practices. Her background in web development, although impressive, does not cover this critical aspect.\n\n3. **Innovated scalable recycling solutions**: The candidate\u2019s resume does not reflect any experience or innovative achievements in developing scalable recycling solutions. Our goal is to transform waste and recycling value chains across Africa, which demands someone who has a track record of working on large-scale environmental or sustainability projects. Sabrina\u2019s portfolio highlights her ability to scale web applications and digital solutions, but not recycling systems.\n\n4. **Managed African regional tech projects**: There is no indication that Sabrina has managed regional technology projects within Africa, or anywhere with similar challenges. Leading technology projects in Africa comes with unique logistical, infrastructural, and cultural challenges that require specific experience and understanding. Her work so far seems to be domestically focused, primarily in a freelancing capacity, with no mention of navigating the complexities of African project implementation.\n\n5. **Strong logistics and supply chain integration**: Our recycling operations heavily depend on integrated, efficient logistics and supply chain systems. Sabrina\u2019s technical experience with web development and some backend integrations (like APIs) does not equate to managing complex supply chain systems in a manufacturing or recycling context. This role demands someone who understands the end-to-end flow of materials and can optimize these elements for better efficiency and output.\n\nAlthough Sabrina Reid appears to be a highly skilled web developer with a passion for technology, her resume does not align with the critical needs of our Head of Technology role at this recycling plant. We need someone with a robust background in sustainability tech, recycling process optimization, and significant regional experience in Africa to drive our vision forward.\n\nGiven these points, I strongly urge the team to consider candidates who have direct experience and proven success in the recycling and waste management industry with a focus on scalability and regional implementation in Africa.\n\n**Source for Evaluation**: Directly paraphrased and critically analyzed from Sabrina Reid's resume/Bio and specific job description provided."
