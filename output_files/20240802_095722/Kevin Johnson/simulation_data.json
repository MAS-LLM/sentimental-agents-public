Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible.

      "CFO": "**Evaluation Criteria:**\n1. **Budget Management**: Proven ability to optimize tech operational costs.\n2. **Financial Compliance**: Expertise in maintaining regulatory and fiscal standards.\n3. **ROI-driven Decisions**: History of tech investments yielding measurable financial returns.\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: Strong focus on minimizing tech-related financial liabilities.\n5. **Vendor Negotiations**: Skilled in achieving cost-effective tech partnerships.\n\n---\n\nAlright team, here's my take on Kevin Johnson for the Head of Technology role given our unique needs at the recycling plant in Kenya.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Budget Management**: Kevin has extensive experience with database management, including work with AWS EC2 instances. His past roles required him to manage diverse databases and ensure their optimization, which inherently involves cost management. This suggests he has the skills to control expenses and optimize our tech operations. However, his resume doesn't explicitly mention experience in optimizing large-scale operational costs, which is a concern for me given the scale we're aiming for.\n\n2. **Financial Compliance**: Kevin has an active TS/SCI clearance indicating he can maintain high standards of regulatory and fiscal compliance. This is crucial for handling sensitive data and aligns with our goal to protect financial and customer information with utmost security.\n\n3. **ROI-driven Decisions**: Kevin's work history shows that he has been deeply involved in the technical side but lacks a clear record of making strategic investment decisions that drive measurable financial returns. Our role requires someone who can weigh in on where to allocate resources effectively to get the best financial outcomes, and his resume does not provide strong evidence of this ability.\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: Given his background in handling secure environments and experience with implementing security measures like STIG on Oracle databases, Kevin has demonstrated an ability to mitigate tech-related risks. This is a plus for safeguarding our infrastructure.\n\n5. **Vendor Negotiations**: Kevin's experience with different tools and technologies may give him some leverage in vendor negotiations due to his technical knowledge. However, there\u2019s no explicit mention of him negotiating or managing vendor contracts, which might be a gap in his suitability for our role involving strategic partnerships and cost-effective tech solutions.\n\n---\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Lack of Leadership in Financial Strategy**: Kevin's resume highlights his technical expertise but does not provide any substantial evidence of experience in leading tech teams through financial strategy decisions. As the Head of Technology, we need someone who can think beyond the technicalities and integrate financial strategy into tech development.\n\n2. **Inadequate Evidence of High ROI Tech Investments**: Although he has experience with databases and a variety of tech tools, there\u2019s no clear track record of making tech investments that yield significant financial returns. We need someone who can clearly demonstrate past successes in this area.\n\n3. **Potential Oversight of Large-scale Project Management**: Kevin\u2019s roles seem concentrated on database administration within specific boundaries. The Head of Technology role in our company demands broader project management experience, especially in a rapidly scaling environment like ours, which he possibly lacks.\n\n4. **Limited Direct Experience with Supply Chain Systems**: While Kevin\u2019s tech expertise is solid, his resume does not indicate extensive work with supply chain systems, which are crucial for our operations. His practical knowledge in that specific area might be limited, which could affect our efficiency.\n\n5. **Strategic Vendor Relationships**: As I mentioned, Kevin hasn't provided evidence of having successfully managed vendor relationships, which is critical for achieving cost-effective tech partnerships and ensuring our technology needs align with our budget constraints.\n\n---\n\nTo sum up, although Kevin has strong technical skills and demonstrates some relevant experience in security and risk mitigation, he falls short in critical areas like ROI-driven decision-making, strategic financial leadership, and experience with supply chain systems. For these reasons, I am hesitant to endorse him as our ideal candidate for the Head of Technology in our unique context. We need someone who not only understands the tech but can also drive financial strategy, optimize costs, and make informed investment decisions to maximize our return.",
      "VP of Engineering": "Alright team, let's break down Kevin Johnson's resume in detail based on our specific needs for the Head of Technology role at our recycling plant scale-up in Kenya.\n\n**Proven Proficiency in Scaling Engineering Teams for Industrial Applications:**\nKevin has extensive experience as a Database Administrator, which is impressive, especially with an active TS/SCI clearance. However, there's a distinct lack of direct leadership in scaling engineering teams. Being a DBA doesn't translate seamlessly into leading a large, diverse team of engineers in an industrial context. He hasn't shown experience in personnel management on a scale we require for this role, which is a glaring gap given the extensive team dynamics and leadership the position demands.\n\n**Familiarity with Recycling Technologies and Local Regulatory Requirements:**\nThere is absolutely no mention of recycling technologies or experience in waste management in Kevin\u2019s resume. This is a red flag, considering our industry\u2019s specific regulatory landscape and the need to understand local environmental regulations and practices in Kenya. His background in database administration within different sectors doesn't indicate any familiarity with the unique challenges and compliance issues we face.\n\n**Demonstrated Ability to Drive Innovation in Resource-Constrained Environments:**\nWhile Kevin has worked in challenging environments, especially with governmental and secured projects, there\u2019s little evidence of driving innovation, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Much of his work seems to be maintaining and optimizing existing systems rather than creating new, innovative solutions from scratch. Our plant needs someone who can think creatively and strategically to optimize and innovate within the constraints of our ecosystem.\n\n**Strong Track Record of Optimizing Production Processes for Efficiency:**\nKevin\u2019s resume is heavily skewed towards database optimization and maintenance rather than overall production or process optimization in an industrial environment. We need someone who has a clear understanding of end-to-end production processes, supply chain intricacies, and hands-on experience with operational efficiency in an industrial setting. His database-focused background doesn\u2019t align with these needs.\n\n**Experience Integrating IoT and Automation in Industrial Settings:**\nUnfortunately, Kevin's experience doesn\u2019t highlight any significant work with IoT, sensor integration, or automation within industrial settings. Most of his career has been centered around Oracle databases and SQL servers. While there\u2019s value in his technical background, it doesn\u2019t align with our immediate needs for someone capable of spearheading IoT-driven innovations and automation in our recycling plants.\n\nIn conclusion, while Kevin Johnson has a strong and commendable background in database management and security, he doesn\u2019t meet the specific criteria we need for the Head of Technology role in our recycling plant. We need someone with direct experience in engineering leadership, industrial process optimization, and familiarity with recycling technologies and IoT integration. Kevin\u2019s skill set, though impressive in its own right, doesn't align closely enough with the unique demands and strategic direction of our company. I strongly recommend we continue our search for a candidate who matches our specific needs more closely.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "Alright, let's get straight to evaluating Kevin Johnson's suitability for the role of Head of Technology in our recycling plant scale-up in Kenya.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n1. **Experience managing tech advancements in waste recycling processes**\n2. **Proven track record in scaling recycling technologies in emerging markets**\n3. **Strong knowledge of sustainable and eco-friendly technology solutions**\n4. **Ability to optimize plant operations using innovative tech**\n5. **Leadership in cross-functional team integration within recycling industry**\n\nBased on Kevin Johnson's resume, here's how he measures up:\n\n1. **Experience Managing Tech Advancements in Waste Recycling Processes:**\nKevin seems to have a deep background in database administration and IT management, but there isn't much evidence that he has experience specifically in managing technologies within the waste recycling sector. This is a critical gap since our main challenge is to innovate and advance recycling processes, not just manage databases. \n\n2. **Proven Track Record in Scaling Recycling Technologies in Emerging Markets:**\nAgain, while Kevin's experience is impressive, particularly in high-security environments and database management, there is no mention of experience in scaling technologies within an emerging market context or the recycling industry. Our challenge requires understanding the specific constraints and opportunities of such markets.\n\n3. **Strong Knowledge of Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Technology Solutions:**\nThere's no indication in his resume that Kevin has a background in sustainable technologies or eco-friendly solutions. Our company\u2019s core mission revolves around sustainability, and it's essential that our Head of Technology is deeply versed in this area. His work has been more focused on traditional IT solutions without a sustainability angle.\n\n4. **Ability to Optimize Plant Operations Using Innovative Tech:**\nKevin\u2019s tech skills are undoubted, but his expertise leans heavily towards traditional IT and database management. While he has experience in optimizing database performance, we need someone who can translate innovative technology into our recycling operations to boost efficiency and reduce waste, something his resume does not strongly support.\n\n5. **Leadership in Cross-Functional Team Integration within Recycling Industry:**\nKevin has a solid background in managing teams and ensuring smooth tech operations across various functions. However, this hasn't been within the context of the recycling industry. His leadership skills are commendable, yet the domain knowledge required for the recycling sector is missing.\n\nIn conclusion, while Kevin Johnson is certainly a highly skilled IT professional with a broad and impressive resume, his experience does not align closely enough with the unique requirements of our Head of Technology role at the recycling plant. We need a leader who combines tech-savvy with a deep understanding of the recycling industry and sustainable technologies to truly drive our mission forward. His lack of direct experience in managing and scaling recycling technologies in emerging markets and limited knowledge of sustainable solutions make him less suited for this position.\n\n**To my partners in the conversation**, I strongly urge that we prioritize candidates who bring relevant experience from the recycling sector or similar fields. We can't afford a learning curve in this critical role; we need someone who can hit the ground running and push our technological boundaries from day one. Thank you."

A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage.",
