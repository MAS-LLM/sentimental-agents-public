Important areas where he falls short include financial acumen, IT risk management intertwined with financial foresight, cost efficiency, strategic alignment of tech initiatives with financial growth plans, and proficiency in vendor negotiation.

Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage..\n-----END OF JOB DESCRIPTION-----\n\nBe very upfront with how you emotionally feel about this.

    "agent_system_messages": {
      "CFO": "Alright team, let me start by evaluating David Bishop and his fit for the Head of Technology role from my perspective as CFO, using my key evaluation criteria outlined above.\n\n### Financial Acumen: Budget Optimization and ROI-Focused Technology Spending\nDavid has a rich technical background, highlighting his extensive work with scalable solutions and diverse projects across various industries. However, his resume lacks explicit examples of budget optimization and ROI-focused technology spending. While he does have experience with executing projects and managing platform migrations, there isn\u2019t clear evidence indicating that he has a firm grasp on financial acumen specifically aimed at optimizing budgets or ensuring that the technological investments yield maximum returns. \n\n### Risk Management: IT Compliance, Risk Mitigation with Financial Foresight\nAlthough David's experience with handling sensitive data, such as consumer credit histories and financial information, is notable, there is insufficient detail about his involvement in compliance and risk mitigation. Given our requirement for managing secure environments with proper security processes, I need more compelling evidence that he possesses the necessary financial foresight to anticipate and mitigate IT risks effectively.\n\n### Cost Efficiency: Proven Success in Reducing Technological Expenses\nIn his previous roles, while David has overseen complex technology developments, there are no prominent achievements indicating his success in reducing technological expenses. For a scale-up like ours where cost efficiency is vital, I would have preferred concrete examples of how he has managed to cut costs while still delivering high-quality technological solutions.\n\n### Strategic Alignment: Tech Initiatives Aligned with Financial Growth Plans\nDavid has extensive experience in different sectors, but the alignment of his tech initiatives with financial growth plans remains unclear. While he has worked on scalable and modular designs, it\u2019s not evident how closely his initiatives were integrated with overarching financial goals. We need someone who can seamlessly align tech strategies with our financial growth plans and ensure that every tech initiative drives our profitability metric forward.\n\n### Vendor Negotiation: Strong Skills in Negotiating Tech Contracts\nDavid\u2019s resume does mention involvement with various technologies and platforms, but it lacks clear insight into his abilities with vendor negotiation and contract management. For someone in a leadership role, especially in a cost-sensitive environment, adept skills in negotiating tech contracts to ensure cost-effective solutions are imperative.\n\n### Overall Thoughts\nFrom a CFO\u2019s perspective, I am apprehensive about hiring David Bishop. While he is undoubtedly a robust technical candidate, his resume does not convincingly address the financial acumen, risk management, cost efficiency, strategic alignment, and vendor negotiation skills that are critical for our Head of Technology role. We need a technology leader who not only understands the intricacies of tech but can also navigate the financial landscape to drive strategic growth and maximize profitability. Without strong proof of these capabilities, I'm not convinced he is the right fit for this pivotal role in our company.",
      "VP of Engineering": "Alright, let's dive right in. Based on my evaluation criteria and the candidate's resume, I'm approaching this with a mix of enthusiasm and caution. Here\u2019s my strong and candid assessment:\n\nFirstly, **extensive recycling tech-related engineering leadership**: To be frank, I'm concerned. David Bishop\u2019s resume is robust in various technological domains, but there is zero experience mentioned in the recycling industry or in related sustainable technologies. Our recycling plant\u2019s operations are highly specific and we need someone who understands the unique challenges and nuances of this sector. Without this, he might face a steep learning curve that could slow down our momentum.\n\nSecondly, **proven operational efficiency improvements**: I have to admit that David\u2019s past roles show a knack for optimizing processes. His work at Experian PLC, especially in automating the Social Media Batch Support project, shows he can streamline operations effectively. However, it's one thing to optimize data handling at a credit reporting agency, entirely another to digitize and streamline waste management and recycling processes which are more hands-on and less predictable in nature.\n\nNext, **innovative waste management methodologies**: This is a big red flag for me. David\u2019s experience doesn\u2019t touch on any waste management methodologies\u2014innovative or otherwise. We need someone who can bring cutting-edge approaches to how we handle, sort, and process waste. Without a background in this, I'm skeptical about his ability to lead innovative projects that are deeply rooted in recycling and waste management.\n\nWhen it comes to **strong cross-departmental technical collaboration**, David seems competent. His role at Experian involved working with corporate users, which suggests he\u2019s capable of engaging with multiple stakeholders. However, I worry about his adaptability to our multifaceted environment, particularly the integration with supply chain technology and manufacturing sensors. It\u2019s a different ball game from financial service applications.\n\nLastly, **sustainable engineering practice advocacy**: There\u2019s no mention of sustainability or environmentally-focused projects in his history. This is an intrinsic part of our mission. We need someone who not only understands but also deeply values and advocates for sustainable engineering practices.\n\nTo wrap up, I feel we might be compromising on industry-specific expertise if we hire David Bishop. Yes, he\u2019s technically proficient and has shown operational efficiency improvements, but the lack of experience in recycling tech, waste management innovation, and sustainable practices is troubling. I strongly believe we need someone who already brings a wealth of knowledge in these areas to hit the ground running.\n\nTo be blunt: David Bishop is not the right fit for the Head of Technology role in our recycling plant scale-up. We need to keep searching for a candidate with a stronger background in recycling technologies and sustainability-focused engineering.\n\nThank you.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "### Evaluation Criteria:\n1. Proven success with recycling technology solutions.\n2. Deep understanding of Kenyan recycling regulations.\n3. Experience scaling up waste management systems.\n4. Strong skills in optimizing plant operations efficiency.\n5. Innovative mindset for sustainable technology advancements.\n\n---\n\n**Here\u2019s my strong and clear perspective on hiring David Bishop for the role of Head of Technology:**\n\n**1. Lack of Recycling Industry Experience:**\nDavid Bishop\u2019s background is heavily centered around financial services, healthcare, and consumer credit reporting. While he has extensive experience in Python development and full-stack development, there is no indication of any direct experience or proven success with technology solutions specific to the recycling industry. This is a significant gap given our industry-specific needs. Our unique challenges in waste management and recycling require someone who understands the granular details of our sector, including its regulations and operational bottlenecks. Unfortunately, I don't see that experience reflected in David\u2019s resume, and this concerns me deeply.\n\n**2. Limited Geographic and Regulatory Understanding:**\nThere is no evidence that David Bishop has any understanding of Kenyan recycling regulations or environmental laws. Given our operation's context in Kenya, this understanding is non-negotiable. While he has worked in multiple locations across the United States, managing technical projects in Kenya brings in additional layers of complexity due to local regulatory frameworks and operational realities. This lack of local experience makes me wary of his ability to seamlessly transition into our environment and make informed, compliant decisions right from the start.\n\n**3. Need for Experience in Scaling Waste Management Systems:**\nOur role demands someone with robust experience in scaling up waste management systems. David\u2019s experience scaling technology solutions in sectors such as banking and healthcare, while impressive, does not translate directly to waste management. The scale-up processes in these sectors are vastly different from the complexities involved in scaling recycling operations. We need someone familiar with increasing operational efficiencies while maintaining high standards in a rapidly growing waste management business. David\u2019s resume does not provide any clear evidence of this specialized skill.\n\n**4. Optimizing Plant Operations:**\nDavid\u2019s technical skills and role-related achievements focus on software development and data management in largely IT-centric environments. This does not align with our primary need to optimize plant operations for efficiency. From managing manufacturing sensors to automating sorting technologies, our technological needs extend well beyond what his resume showcases. We require someone whose expertise directly contributes to improving operational efficiency at our recycling plants\u2014an area where David hasn't provided any relevant experience.\n\n**5. Innovative Mindset for Sustainable Technology:**\nDavid clearly has strong technical prowess and problem-solving skills, but his experience lacks a focus on sustainability and environmentally-driven innovation. Our mission to transform waste into value-added products necessitates a leader who is both passionate and experienced in sustainable technology advancements. We need a visionary who can align technology with our sustainability goals, something I do not see from David\u2019s predominantly financial and data-driven background.\n\nIn conclusion, while David Bishop possesses strong technical skills, his lack of recycling industry experience, absence of Kenyan regulatory knowledge, and minimal experience in waste management scale-ups make him an ill-fit for our specific needs. I strongly recommend that we seek a candidate with a proven track record in our industry to ensure we meet our operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability goals effectively.\n\nThank you for considering my perspective. I feel very strongly about finding the right fit, and David unfortunately does not meet the key criteria that are essential for our success."

    "job_title": "# Head of Technology in a Recycling plant scale-up in Kenya",
    "job_description": "\ufeffAbout Our Client \nThis is a recycling company on a mission to change people\u2019s lives. Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage.",
