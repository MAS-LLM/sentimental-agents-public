Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home.

      "CFO": "Alright, team, listen up. We need to talk about Jennifer Smith's candidacy for the Head of Technology role at our recycling plant scale-up in Kenya. I'm going to be very direct with my sentiments here because this decision impacts our financial strategy significantly.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n1. **Financial Acumen in Tech Investments:** We need someone who can make savvy financial decisions in technology investments. This isn't just about knowing tech; they need to understand the financial implications of those tech choices.\n2. **Cost-Effective Technology Implementation Experience:** Has this candidate demonstrated the ability to implement cost-effective technologies? We can't afford to waste money on expensive solutions that don't deliver ROI.\n3. **Risk Management in Technology Projects:** It's critical to assess the risk associated with technology implementations and have strategies to mitigate those risks.\n4. **ROI-Focused Decision-Making Skills:** We need a candidate who prioritizes return on investment in every decision they make.\n5. **Budget Adherence History:** The ability to manage budgets and hit financial targets is non-negotiable for this role.\n\n**Points of Concern and Consideration:**\n\n1. **Financial Acumen in Tech Investments:**\n   - Jennifer has experience ranging from graphic design to web application engineering support and research. However, there's no clear indication that she has managed significant technology investments with a focus on financial returns. This is crucial for us. We need someone who can look at a potential tech investment and accurately forecast the financial outcomes. Her bio doesn't showcase this.\n\n2. **Cost-Effective Technology Implementation Experience:**\n   - Her experience with front-end web design and mobile applications is noted, but this role involves much more complex technology ecosystems, including IoT sensors, ERP systems, and predictive analytics. These are high-stake areas where cost overruns can be catastrophic. Has she satisfied this criterion in past roles? I don't see sufficient evidence.\n\n3. **Risk Management in Technology Projects:**\n   - Risk management is about foreseeing potential pitfalls in tech projects and having contingencies in place. There's nothing in Jennifer's resume that speaks to her handling of high-risk technology projects effectively. This is a glaring gap that we cannot overlook. We've got too much at stake.\n\n4. **ROI-Focused Decision-Making Skills:**\n   - Does she have a track record of decisions that maximize ROI? Her freelance background might indicate adaptability and resourcefulness, but has she consistently driven projects to deliver substantial returns? This point is ambiguous in her profile, and vagueness does not bode well for high-risk roles.\n\n5. **Budget Adherence History:**\n   - Again, with her freelance and arts-focused history, where is the evidence of managing large-scale budgets? Budget adherence is not just about keeping costs under control; it's about strategically allocating resources to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. I don\u2019t see a history of handling complex budgets.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nWe need a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader for our Head of Technology role. While Jennifer displays a breadth of experience and creativity, she lacks the deep financial and strategic expertise required to lead our tech investments effectively. Her profile might fit a different role but not this one, given the fiscal demands and scale of operation we're looking at.\n\nI strongly advise we continue our search for a candidate who not only understands technology but also the financial intricacies that come with scaling up a tech-driven operation in a cost-effective and risk-managed manner. We need someone with a proven history in financial acumen, cost-effective implementations, and budget adherence.\n\nLet's safeguard our finances and ensure we make a decision that aligns with our strategic goals. Thank you.",
      "VP of Engineering": "My evaluation criteria are specifically designed to ensure that we are making a selection that optimizes not only our current operations but also the innovative vision we have for scaling our recycling efforts. Here they are again for clarity: \n\n1. Proven experience optimizing engineering processes in waste management.\n2. Strong grasp of sustainability and eco-efficiency technologies.\n3. Ability integrating automation for scalable recycling operations.\n4. Sound leadership in rapid engineering team scaling.\n5. Deep understanding of regulatory compliance in Kenya.\n\nLet's dive into Jennifer Smith\u2019s candidacy. \n\nFirst, on the surface level of her experience, we don\u2019t see any substantial evidence of her dealing with waste management or even sustainability projects. Her background seems quite varied but not in a complementary way for this specific role. For example, her experience as a Freelance Designer and Systems Administrator is too distant from what we need. This role demands someone who has shown they can directly impact and optimize engineering processes in a waste management setting, and Jennifer lacks this specific domain expertise.\n\nWhile Jennifer does have some technical and multi-disciplinary skills, her strongest suits\u2014graphic design, web development, and machine learning\u2014don't align well with the core needs of our function in waste management and recycling. We need someone who has a track record in sustainability and eco-efficiency technologies. This is non-negotiable because these are pivotal to our mission and the way we execute our operations.\n\nAs for integrating automation for scalable recycling operations, there\u2019s no clear demonstration in her resume that she has handled large-scale integration projects. Our next Head of Technology needs to guide us into a future with a higher degree of automation to streamline our recycling processes, and alas, she does not fulfill this particular need.\n\nJennifer\u2019s leadership experience\u2014teaching children coding basics and public speaking\u2014is a very different caliber compared to the kind of senior, high-stakes leadership we require. This job is about constructing a high-performing technical team capable of innovating at scale, not just managing small teaching sessions or short-term intern projects. We need someone who has led large, complex engineering teams through rapid scaling, which I don't see evidenced here. \n\nLastly, regulatory compliance in Kenya is a critical area for this role. Her career journey does not appear to show an intricate understanding of the local regulatory framework, which is crucial for us as we aim to scale up our operations and maintain compliance with local laws and international standards.\n\nIn conclusion, while Jennifer Smith might be bright and talented in her own domains, she does not meet the specific needs we have outlined for this critical position. We need someone who is a proven leader in waste management and sustainability technologies, can scale automation efforts, and deeply understands Kenyan regulatory frameworks. With these criteria non-negotiable for the success of our mission, I highly recommend we continue our search for a more fitting candidate.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of this. I oversee operations, optimize processes, manage staff, and ensure compliance. My top priorities are to minimize waste, maximize efficiency, ensure safety, and achieve sustainability targets. Here are my evaluation criteria for Jennifer Smith based on this context:\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n1. **Proficiency in Recycling Technology and Waste Management Systems:**\n   - Jennifer's resume does not show any significant experience in recycling technology or waste management systems. Her background is heavily focused on design, web development, and data analysis, which could be valuable but isn't specific to recycling.\n  \n2. **Strong Leadership in Scaling Operations Sustainably:**\n   - While she has experience across a variety of fields, there's little evidence of her leading large-scale operations, especially in a physical and logistics-centric environment like ours.\n\n3. **Experience with Kenyan Environmental Regulations and Compliance:**\n   - There is no indication that Jennifer has any exposure or familiarity with Kenyan environmental regulations or the compliance environment here. This is a major concern given the regulatory landscape we navigate daily.\n\n4. **Proven Track Record in Optimizing Recycling Processes:**\n   - Jennifer's track record shows her as a versatile designer and developer but lacks any specific achievements or projects related to optimizing recycling processes or similar industrial operations.\n\n5. **Innovation in Cost-Effective Recycling Solutions:**\n   - Jennifer appears to have a creative and innovative streak, but without direct experience in recycling, it's uncertain how her skills in data analysis and design translate into cost-effective solutions for our industry.\n\n**Point of View:**\n\nLet's be blunt here. Jennifer Smith does not meet the key criteria required for the Head of Technology role in our recycling plant. \n\n1. **Proficiency in Recycling Technology and Waste Management Systems**: She lacks the specific technical skills and experience in recycling technology. Our industry is unique and requires hands-on experience with the systems that handle waste conversion. Her background in graphic design and web development is too far removed from our technical requirements.\n\n2. **Strong Leadership in Scaling Operations Sustainably**: Sustainable scaling in a recycling context is vastly different from scaling software projects or managing design teams. We need someone who has led complex physical operations, understands supply chain intricacies, and has a history of integrating sustainable practices into every layer of the process.\n\n3. **Experience with Kenyan Environmental Regulations and Compliance**: This is non-negotiable. Kenya has its specific regulatory frameworks and compliance requirements, and we can\u2019t afford a learning curve here. Jennifer has no demonstrable experience with Kenyan regulations or any indication of having worked in a similar regulatory environment.\n\n4. **Proven Track Record in Optimizing Recycling Processes**: We need a candidate with a proven record of driving efficiency and innovation specifically within recycling or waste management. Jennifer's resume, while impressive in a generalist sense, doesn\u2019t provide evidence of such achievements.\n\n5. **Innovation in Cost-Effective Recycling Solutions**: While I appreciate her innovative mindset, there's a risk in assuming her skills in data analysis and web development will seamlessly transfer into revolutionary recycling solutions without any direct experience.\n\nIn summary, as the Recycling Plant Manager, I cannot endorse Jennifer for the Head of Technology role. We need someone with deep expertise in our industry, a proven track record of operational leadership, and familiarity with our specific regulatory environment. Jennifer, unfortunately, does not fit this mold. Let\u2019s focus on candidates who better align with the critical needs of our plant and our ambitious sustainability targets."

    "job_description": "\ufeffAbout Our Client \nThis is a recycling company on a mission to change people\u2019s lives. Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans.
