Education Bachelor's\n\n-----END OF CANDIDATE RESUME/BIO-----\n)\n\n\nfor this role: # Head of Technology in a Recycling plant scale-up in Kenya, \ngiven this role description: \n\n-----START OF JOB DESCRIPTION-----\n\ufeffAbout Our Client \nThis is a recycling company on a mission to change people\u2019s lives. Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage..\n-----END OF JOB DESCRIPTION-----\n\nBe very upfront with how you emotionally feel about this.

      "CFO": "Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. As the CFO, I see some clear advantages and significant concerns about hiring Austin Wilson for the Head of Technology role. Considering my evaluation criteria, here's my assessment:\n \n**Financial Acumen**: \nAustin has a wealth of experience across various industries including health insurance and banking, which are highly regulated and typically budget-conscious sectors. This background suggests he could align technical initiatives with our financial goals. However, his resume does not explicitly mention any direct involvement in budgeting or financial strategy. His experience seems to be more hands-on technical rather than strategic, and that raises a red flag for me in terms of financial oversight.\n\n**Cost Efficiency**:\nHe possesses extensive experience in different tech stacks and frameworks which could allow for cost-effective solutions. But again, there\u2019s no information indicating how successfully he managed or optimized budgets, ROI, or financial metrics in previous roles. We need someone who has a proven record of maximizing value while controlling costs and Austin\u2019s resume doesn't provide enough evidence of that capability.\n\n**Regulatory Compliance**:\nAustin\u2019s involvement in banking and health insurance indicates a potential familiarity with regulatory environments. Yet, his resume lacks any mention of security processes or compliance expertise. In our industry, dealing with waste and recycling, adherence to regulatory standards is crucial for avoiding fines and maintaining certifications, and we cannot overlook this.\n\n**Scalability**:\nHis experience with large corporations like Pfizer and AT&T is promising in terms of managing scalable solutions. But scalability in a high-turnover tech environment with consistent budget constraints is quite a different animal. He has ample technical skills but again, no solid evidence of managing and scaling technology under tight financial scrutiny and constraints.\n\n**Data-Driven Decision Making**:\nAustin\u2019s extensive experience with different analytical tools and methodologies is a strong advantage. His background indicates he could be someone who makes data-driven decisions, which aligns perfectly with our need to utilize metrics for financial strategies. This is one area where he excels.\n\nIn conclusion, while Austin brings a diverse and extensive technical background, I have reservations based on our specific needs:\n- The lack of direct financial management experience.\n- No explicit evidence of budgeting or ROI optimization.\n- Unclear regulatory compliance experience.\n \nThese gaps could pose significant risks to our financial stability and operational performance. We're talking about scaling operations in Kenya with considerable financial constraints - we need a leader who has navigated these waters successfully before.\n\nTherefore, I cannot confidently endorse his candidacy without addressing these concerns. We might need to probe deeper in a final interview or look at other candidates who bring a more robust financial oversight capability to the table.\n\nLet's be thorough and make sure the candidate aligns not just technically, but financially as well.",
      "VP of Engineering": "**Evaluation Criteria:**\n\n1. Proven capability in scaling industrial processes for growth.\n2. Advanced understanding of recycling technologies and innovations.\n3. Track record of optimizing engineering teams for efficiency.\n4. Strategic planning for technology infrastructure amid rapid expansion.\n5. Experience in mitigating technical and operational risks in scale-ups.\n\n**Perspective:**\n\nHaving thoroughly reviewed Austin Wilson's resume, I feel quite strongly that Austin's skillset is a perfect mix of what we need and what we should avoid. Let me break this down for you.\n\n**Pros**\n\n1. **Proven Capability in Scaling**: Austin has consistently demonstrated his ability to scale technology within large organizations such as Pfizer, AT&T, Anthem Inc., and The Home Depot. His extensive experience with cloud-based solutions, modular design, and scalable architectures are precisely what we need to take our operations to the next level.\n\n2. **Diverse Technical Experience**: Austin's experience spans multiple industries\u2014healthcare, telecommunications, insurance, eCommerce, and banking. This breadth of experience suggests he can bring innovative, cross-industry best practices to our recycling plant.\n\n3. **Strategic Planning for Technology Infrastructure**: Austin has led technology roadmaps and design initiatives in various demanding roles. Given that we aim to redesign our architecture and processes for scale, Austin's strategic mindset for technology infrastructure is invaluable.\n\n4. **Optimizing Engineering Teams**: He has a strong track record of leading and improving engineering teams. His experience in Agile and Scrum methodologies will be beneficial for fostering a dynamic, high-performance culture within our tech teams and ensuring efficient project execution.\n\n**Cons**\n\n1. **Lack of Recycling Industry Experience**: Austin's resume does not indicate any experience with recycling technologies or the specific challenges this industry faces. This is a substantial gap given that our business revolves around recycling. While his technical skills are impressive, they might not seamlessly translate into industry-specific innovations without a steep learning curve.\n\n2. **Operational Risk Management**: There is little evidence of his experience in managing technical and operational risks within scale-ups specifically in industrial settings like ours. His previous experiences seem more focused on conventional corporate environments rather than the unique requirements and risk profiles of a recycling plant, especially in a rapidly growing market like Kenya.\n\nIn conclusion, while I am impressed with Austin's technical prowess and strategic abilities, I have significant reservations about his lack of direct experience in our industry and the specific risk management challenges we face. We need a candidate who not only has the technical acumen but also an intrinsic understanding of recycling technologies and industrial processes. My strong recommendation is to consider these gaps carefully before making a decision.\n\nThank you.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "Alright team, let's get into this. I'm going to be as blunt and upfront as possible because this position is crucial for our operations.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n1. Proven recycling technologies implementation success in similar environments.\n2. Expertise in optimizing machinery for Kenyan recycling challenges.\n3. Experience in scaling operations and managing rapid technology upgrades.\n4. Strong network with local suppliers and tech innovators.\n5. Capability to align tech solutions with sustainability objectives.\n\n### Pros:\n1. **Experience with Diverse Technologies:** Austin has a very robust background in various technologies \u2014 HTML5, CSS3, Angular, React, Vue, JavaScript frameworks, and backend systems (Java, Node.js, databases, etc.). This extensive knowledge base could be invaluable for the wide array of technological solutions we'll need.\n   \n2. **Leadership and Team Management:** He has extensive experience leading teams, including remote offshore development, which aligns with our need for a strong leader to manage our tech staff effectively and keep everyone aligned with our tech strategy.\n\n3. **Agile Methodologies:** The candidate has considerable experience in Agile/Scrum methodologies, which is crucial for fluid and dynamic environments like ours. Efficient sprints and clear planning are key to scaling up our operations smoothly.\n\n### Cons:\n1. **Lack of Specific Recycling Industry Experience:** Nowhere in his resume does he demonstrate prior experience working in the recycling industry or dealing specifically with recycling technologies. This is a major red flag for me because we need someone who understands the nitty-gritty of recycling tech to maximize output and minimize waste effectively.\n\n2. **No Mention of Kenyan Market Experience:** Austin\u2019s resume does not reflect any familiarity with the Kenyan market, its unique challenges, or local suppliers and tech innovators. We need someone who has a strong network and understands the specific operational hurdles we face here in Kenya.\n\n3. **Scaling Operations Experience:** While he has worked on large-scale projects, there isn't clear evidence of his ability to scale operations rapidly in a context similar to ours. Scaling a tech stack for a healthcare or telecom industry is immensely different from doing so in a less predictable, physical environment like recycling.\n\n4. **Alignment with Sustainability:** There's not much in his resume that suggests a strong alignment with sustainability objectives. We need a Head of Technology who can embed sustainability into every tech solution and operation.\n\n### My Perspective:\n\nWhile Austin Wilson demonstrates strong technical leadership and vast experience across various tech stacks, his lack of direct experience in the recycling industry and the Kenyan market is a significant drawback for me. This position requires someone who not only understands technology at a high level but also has proven expertise in implementing recycling technologies in similar environments. His unfamiliarity with local challenges and suppliers could impede our ability to optimize machinery specific to Kenya's needs and scale operations rapidly.\n\nUltimately, as the **Recycling Plant Manager**, my top priority is efficient operations, maximizing output, prioritizing safety, and minimizing waste. Therefore, we need someone who has a direct and substantial background in recycling tech and Kenyan operations. Austin Wilson, despite his impressive tech resume, does not meet these critical criteria. We need to prioritize candidates who can bring this specific contextual knowledge and experience to the table.\n\nThank you."

    "job_title": "# Head of Technology in a Recycling plant scale-up in Kenya",
    "job_description": "\ufeffAbout Our Client \nThis is a recycling company on a mission to change people\u2019s lives. Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage.",
