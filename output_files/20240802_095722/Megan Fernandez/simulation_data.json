Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap.

      "CFO": "Alright team, let's dive into the discussion about Megan Fernandez's suitability for the role of Head of Technology at our recycling plant scale-up in Kenya. My evaluation criteria focus on five key areas: Cost Management Expertise, Risk Assessment Skills, ROI Focus, Financial Reporting, and Cross-Department Synergy. Keeping these in mind, here\u2019s my detailed perspective.\n\n1. **Cost Management Expertise**:\n   Megan's resume does not provide substantial evidence of her ability to manage technology costs efficiently. She's been working as a freelance front-end developer recently, and before that, she had a one-year stint at ARPI Network. Neither position suggests she has experience with cost management at the scale we need for this role. We need someone who can optimize our technology spend \u2013 it\u2019s critical for our financial health and sustainability. Her background doesn\u2019t reassure me that she can handle or even understands the tech budget constraints in a large-scale, diverse, and high-impact environment like ours.\n\n2. **Risk Assessment Skills**:\n   Handling financial risks in technology isn't just about coding; it's about foreseeing technological pitfalls and their financial impacts. There's no indication in Megan\u2019s resume that she has experience identifying, assessing, or mitigating such risks, especially within complex, multi-layered systems. We can\u2019t afford to take a chance on someone who hasn\u2019t demonstrated an aptitude for risk management in high-stakes scenarios.\n\n3. **ROI Focus**:\n   This role demands a proven track record in tech investments yielding high returns. Megan's background lacks any mention of her involvement in driving strategic tech investments or evidence that her work led to measurable financial gains. This is a glaring gap. We need a tech leader who makes smart investment decisions and ensures we get the maximum return, something she hasn\u2019t shown she can do.\n\n4. **Financial Reporting**:\n   Our Head of Technology must be proficient in tracking budgets and financial forecasting. There\u2019s no evidence in Megan\u2019s resume of her ability to handle financial reporting. Managing finances in a tech leadership role involves meticulous planning and communicating financial health and projections to stakeholders. Her experience doesn\u2019t seem to cover these vital aspects.\n\n5. **Cross-Department Synergy**:\n   Aligning tech initiatives with the company\u2019s financial goals requires someone who has significant experience working across departments. Megan\u2019s background as a front-end developer, predominantly focusing on coding and development, doesn\u2019t suggest she has the necessary exposure to cross-departmental collaboration at a strategic level. We need someone accustomed to working with various departments to align tech projects with our finance goals.\n\nIn conclusion, while Megan Fernandez seems skilled in her technical domain as a front-end developer, she profoundly lacks the experience and skills required for a high-stakes, multi-faceted leadership role like this. We need a candidate whose experience aligns more closely with large-scale technological management, strategic investment, financial reporting, and cross-functional collaboration. My strong recommendation is that we continue our search for a more suitable candidate. Our focus should be on someone with a demonstrable track record in technology cost management, risk mitigation, and delivering high ROI, all crucial for our ambitious goals and financial health.\n\nThank you for considering my perspective.",
      "VP of Engineering": "Alright, let's dive into this. First, let's lay out the evaluation criteria I'm using to assess this candidate:\n\n1. **Demonstrated ability to scale tech in emerging markets**\n2. **Expertise in recycling tech innovation and optimization**\n3. **Proven track record managing tech teams in resource-constrained environments**\n4. **Experience integrating technology with local regulatory compliance**\n5. **Data-driven decision-making using predictive analytics and IoT**\n\nConsidering these criteria, here are my thoughts on Megan Fernandez:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. **Front-End Development Skills:** Megan has a solid background as a front end developer. This could be beneficial for ensuring a seamless user experience in consumer-facing applications.\n2. **International Experience:** Megan has experience working internationally (in Poland), which shows she might adapt to new cultures and working environments. This could be a plus for a role based in Kenya with a mission focused on scalability in Africa.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. **Lack of Relevant Experience:** Megan\u2019s resume doesn\u2019t show any leadership experience in a fast-growing or supply chain company, much less one in the recycling sector. The role I'm considering requires a CTO level experience with +10 years in diverse technical work, which I don\u2019t see showcased in her profile.\n2. **Scaling Tech in Emerging Markets:** I see no evidence of her having scaled technology in emerging markets or having experience in environments that face significant resource constraints. This is crucial given our goal to expand across Africa and manage our operations effectively.\n3. **Recycling Tech and Optimization:** Her background focuses solely on front end development. There\u2019s no indication of understanding, let alone optimizing, technologies specific to recycling, which is a must for our head role.\n4. **Management Experience:** Managing and scaling world-class engineering teams is a significant part of this role. I don\u2019t see any proof of Megan managing even small tech teams, let alone large, scalable teams required for our objectives.\n5. **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Predictive analytics and IoT are explicitly mentioned in the job description. Megan\u2019s bio does not reflect any experience with these technologies, which are essential for the data-driven approach we need.\n\nIn conclusion, while Megan\u2019s front end development skills are commendable, her profile lacks essential experiences and qualifications that are intrinsic to this role\u2019s success. The absence of leadership experience in scaling operations, particularly in the recycling tech sector within emerging markets, makes her an unsuitable candidate for this critical position.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, but from my perspective, it\u2019s clear Megan Fernandez doesn\u2019t fit the bill for the Head of Technology at our recycling plant scale-up. Let's focus our search on someone who aligns closely with our outlined criteria and has a proven track record that matches our ambitious goals.",
      "Recycling Plant Manager": "Evaluating Megan Fernandez for the Head of Technology role in our recycling plant scale-up in Kenya requires close scrutiny, especially given my priorities and objectives. Here\u2019s my perspective:\n\nFirst, let\u2019s consider her depth of recycling technology knowledge for sustainable growth. Megan\u2019s resume primarily highlights front-end development skills with freelance and in-house experience in Warsaw, Poland. There\u2019s no specific mention of experience or knowledge in recycling technology. This is a significant concern. Our industry needs expertise in recycling technology to drive sustainable initiatives, which she doesn\u2019t appear to have.\n\nNext, her proven track record in process optimization and innovation is critical. While Megan\u2019s front-end development work may involve some level of process optimization, it\u2019s not directly applicable to our needs. We require someone with demonstrable skills in innovating within a supply chain or recycling context\u2014streamlining processes from waste collection to material processing. Megan\u2019s resume does not indicate such experience.\n\nAs for familiarity with African regulatory compliance, her experience is entirely based in Poland. There\u2019s no indication she has worked in any African countries or has awareness of the specific regulatory frameworks we must navigate in Kenya. This is crucial, given that compliance can significantly impact operational efficiency and sustainability efforts.\n\nExperience in scaling tech solutions in emerging markets is another key criterion. Megan has been working as a developer, which is quite different from scaling tech solutions in a large, complex environment like ours. We need someone who knows the intricacies of deploying scalable technology in an emerging market, with all its unique challenges. Her background does not suggest she has this experience.\n\nLastly, leadership in cross-functional, multicultural environments is vital. Megan\u2019s resume doesn't highlight significant leadership roles, particularly in diverse settings. Managing a technology team within a recycling plant in Kenya will require strong leadership skills to harmonize various teams and ensure smooth operations. \n\nTo sum up, I have strong reservations about Megan Fernandez\u2019s suitability for this role. She lacks the necessary recycling technology knowledge, process optimization experience, familiarity with African regulations, experience scaling solutions in emerging markets, and leadership in multicultural environments. While she may be a skilled front-end developer, her profile does not align with the strategic direction and technical complexities of our project.\n\nGiven our specific needs, I strongly urge us to seek a candidate with a proven track record in these areas to ensure we can meet our ambitious goals for sustainable growth and operational efficiency."
