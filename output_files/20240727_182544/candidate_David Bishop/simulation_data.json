Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage..\n-----END OF JOB DESCRIPTION-----\n\nBe very upfront with how you emotionally feel about this.

    "job_title": "# Head of Technology in a Recycling plant scale-up in Kenya",
    "job_description": "\ufeffAbout Our Client \nThis is a recycling company on a mission to change people\u2019s lives. Waste pickers have aspirations, demanding schedules, and aim to provide the best quality service, just like the rest of us. Unfortunately, they\u2019re often undervalued for the essential service they provide.\nThis firm offers pickers premium prices and additional benefits for cleaning up their community environment and supplying recyclable material. That material is processed and returned to manufacturer supply chains, reducing material cost and waste. To put this mission front and centre, the company became the first recycler certified as B-Corp in Africa.\nSo far, their network of +2500 waste collectors has helped them recycle 6000 tons of waste and create 120 new jobs and counting. They operate across Kenya today and continue to expand, starting with the development of a new state of the art facility.\nOver the next few years, with your help, this company will transform waste and recycling value chains in the global south with a cloud-based, digital-first approach that enables them to operate at scale across Africa while re-defining the value of waste to new supplier categories. They already have strategic partners helping to innovate track & trace, fair & local collection, and sales.\nAs the complexity of their work and ambition for impact grows, they\u2019ll need creative leaders with a genuine passion to make a difference at scale.\nAbout The Role \nThe company is looking for a high-energy, rigorous, and strategic leader with diverse technical experience to head the (re)design of their architecture and organisation for scale. A successful candidate will bring a structured process, solid people management, and cutting edge technologies to a relatively traditional industry.\nWith this in mind, the role reports to the Chief Innovation Officer where new ideas and \norganisational strategy get transformed into real product and process innovations. In addition, the Head of Technology will work closely with operating Country Managers on their supply chain and facility technology.\nThey will oversee all technology, from manufacturing sensors to consumer applications, to corporate administration. Beyond their direct reports, this leader should expect to engage with strategic partners, functional leaders, and specialist advisors to develop and achieve business goals at a healthy ROI.\nIn brief, you will build a scalable architecture, automated processes, simple product experiences, and a reliable team for the short and long term.\nFinally, we realise everyone has personal commitments outside of work. To enable people to work and live at their best, the company supports flexible work. Sometimes work takes place in the industrial area plant, at other times in a shared workspace for innovation, and sometimes from home. They expect leaders to work with their teams to design a high performance, values-aligned work environment.\nWhile the day-to-day office is flexible, the position is based in Nairobi, Kenya and may require up to 30% travel in Kenya and internationally.\nSalaries are competitive and commensurate with qualifications and experience.\nResponsibilities:\nScalable Architecture \nTechnical Vision \nMap out the right mix of external and internal components to strengthen and easily manage multiple stakeholder needs and business growth plans. Advise leadership on technical investment decisions.\nMigration Roadmap \nGather, define, and prioritise user stories and associated development requirements based on the scaling business strategy and customer needs. This requires taking the initiative to speak with clients, stakeholders, advisors, and peers to develop individual sprint plans up to long-term milestones.\nModular Design \nEnsure interoperability between existing and new applications. Build the system to plug and play with new applications and enable easier entry into new countries or offer new services.\nAutomated Processes \nOperations Optimization \nCollect and translate data as well as introduce technology to simplify processes and reduce manual tasks across the supply chain including collection, sorting, processing, distribution, and administration.\nPredictive Analytics \nDevelop and integrate self-reporting and sensor data to improve forecasting. Lay the groundwork for future AI investments (e.g., computer vision plastic identification and mix estimations)\nSimple Product Experience \nClear Actions \nDesign and develop features that are easy to access, obvious to follow, and fast to complete. This should limit the need for follow-up support service and/or human intervention.\nMulti-Modal \nEnsure products work on any type of device and work by text, app, or web. Front-end information should seamlessly integrate with other processes and players along the supply chain.\nReliable Team \nPerformance Standards \nCreate expectations based on technical practice areas, expectations of MGA stakeholders, and consumer product benchmarks (inc. security and up-time). Enable quality execution through training, examples to follow, and regular reviews.\nDevelopment Process\nStructure, organise, and fluidly execute sprints by introducing agile development (and other best practices) as well as establishing open/clear communication practices with stakeholder teams.\nTalent Management \nDevelop and fill new jobs as needed to execute the technical roadmap. Prioritise training and development of the existing team whenever possible. Manage and ensure the performance of external partners is at or above the internal staff.\nTechnical Domains:\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nConsumer-facing Mobile Applications \nPartner and Operator Application \nData Engineering and Analytics \nIOT Sensors and Manual Entry Devices \nERP and Related Operational Systems \nAll Functional Software Applications \nAll Personal Computing Devices \nCloud Infrastructure \nSecurity Policies and Procedures \nOperating Budgets and Tech Investment ROI \nRelease Schedules and Quality Assurance Testing\nExperience and Skills:\n\t\u25cf\t+5 years in CTO / technology leadership role in a fast-growing or supply chain company\t\u25cf\t+10 years diverse technical work experience\n\t\u25cf\tHired, led, and scaled world-class engineer/developer teams delivering high-quality \toutputs for customer-facing and internal requirements\n\t\u25cf\tFull-stack experience using multiple languages and frameworks is an advantage\t\u25cf\tSome familiarity with AI, data science and machine learning techniques\n\t\u25cf\tHave managed secure environments that contain sensitive information (e.g. customer \tprofiles, financial information, regulatory filings etc) with the relevant security processes \tin place.\n\u25cf\tUnderstanding of budgets, business planning, and investment business cases\u25cf\tExperience with selecting, measuring, and managing suppliers and vendors\u25cf\tOutstanding track record of delivering complex technology developments and \tprogrammes\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\nFamiliarity with cloud-computing platforms \nSkilled in planning and forming strategic roadmaps to ensure high-quality output Very strong communication skills and comfort speaking to high stakes audiences Experience overseeing engineering teams in an agile environment \nGood knowledge of DevOps toolchains and processes \nDegree in Information Technology, Computer Science, or another equivalent Qualifications in Agile or Project Management an advantage.",
